# roman-arabic
Convert between roman and arabic numerals

One half of the solution done. To convert from arabic to roman numerals. 
As of now input is not given at runtime. Input is hardcoded into the 
variable num2 for each instance of conversion. I'll be changing it to 
accept the input at runtime.

Reverse translation : Roman to Arabic done sans error checking. Here 
again, the input is hard coded into the program using the variable num4.
